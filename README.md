# **L**\<redacted\> **O**pensource **R**ules **E**ngine

## Summary

This project aims to be an implementation of the rules for the \<redacted\> TCG. It should ideally be useable by as many target platforms and game engines as possible.

It is currently written in csharp because both the Godot and Unity game engines both support that language. Investigation can be done into transpiling to other languages, like Java and Javascript.

This is currently a project that runs in Godot, but the RulesEngine library should be separated from Godot at some future point.

I'm flexible on ideas / programming languages / goals etc, feel free to throw around ideas.

## Desired Features

 - Full rules implementation + tests.
 - Websocket support with client and server libraries.
 - Transpiling to Java, Javascript, other languages.
 - Support for creators to write a rules engine as a plugin (for other games), to be used generically by the engine.


## Work Done

Not much unfortunately, just a basic UI and minimal implementation of basic rules.
